## Hi, I'm Aditya

In the past, I've worked on open-sourcing deep learning research for [time series classification](https://github.com/adityamakkar000/SignSpeak) at the University of Waterloo and raised $10k for a [fire prediction pipeline](https://github.com/FireWatch-ai/fireWatch) 🔥. Additionally, I've conducted computational physics research at the University of Toronto, developing and presenting [general relativity raytracers](https://github.com/zanebeeai/TraceGR).

I currently study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and love exploring how things work from the ground up. Feel free to reach out to me at *aditya.makkar@uwaterloo.ca*.
